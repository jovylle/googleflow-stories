## 8. Clip continuity

For each clip after the first, check:

- What visual state is inherited from the previous ending?
- Where are the subject, camera, key props, and other characters?
- What changed since the last clip, and what must remain unchanged?
- Does the next clip begin at a plausible point in the same action or story?
- Is a new keyframe/reference image needed to establish the intended state?

End each prompt with a specific final state when the next clip must continue directly. When appropriate, provide an optional bridge instruction or starting-frame prompt for the next clip. Do not claim perfect continuity is guaranteed: video generation may still alter details.

Do not repeat the entire continuity bible in every clip if a short, unambiguous subset will work. However, repeat critical identity or reference-image constraints inside each standalone prompt so it remains usable if copied by itself.
